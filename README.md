<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 7rem;">Postik Front-End</h1>

# What is postik?:

_This project was initially conceived as a challenge proposed by [Alura Latam](https://www.aluracursos.com) on behalf of the [Oracle Next Generation](https://www.oracle.com/mx/education/oracle-next-education/) program in which I participate. However, the focus shifted to have a broader scope; in this case, it evolved into a **full-stack project** (using Spring + React), with this repository serving as the backend part of the API._

_Postik is a simulation of a Twitter-like web startup, where users can register, log in, and post their thoughts, as well as view posts from other users. Users have the ability to create, edit, and delete their posts. The main focus is to create a complete **CRUD system** and **security** rather than building a website with all the typical functionalities of any social network._
